# Performance Metrics and Monitoring

Monitoring system performance is critical, especially for components handling real-time processing and high-volume data. Integrating performance monitoring and alerting tools allows you to track key metrics such as system latency, resource utilization, and throughput. This documentation outlines approaches and tools to establish robust performance monitoring.

## Recommended Tools
- **Prometheus**: An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.
- **Grafana**: A powerful visualization tool that works with Prometheus to display real-time dashboards.
- **New Relic**: A cloud-based monitoring solution that provides in-depth performance analytics and alerting capabilities.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Latency**: Track response times and processing delays, especially in real-time and audio processing modules.
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage to identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Throughput**: Measure the volume of data processed over time to ensure systems are operating within expected capacity.
- **Error Rates**: Continuously assess the rate of errors to catch and address issues promptly.

## Integration Example
### Prometheus and Grafana
1. **Prometheus Setup**: Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application endpoints. Ensure your services expose metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.
2. **Grafana Dashboard**: Connect Grafana to Prometheus and create dashboards to visualize real-time metrics and set up alerts for critical performance thresholds.

Example configuration snippet for Prometheus:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'teleprompter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']  # Replace with your service host and port
```

## Alerting
- Set up alerts in Prometheus or New Relic to notify your team when metrics exceed defined thresholds.
- Alerts can be sent via email, Slack, or other communication channels integrated with your monitoring solution.

By integrating these performance monitoring tools, you gain real-time insights into your systemâ€™s operational health, enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance issues.
