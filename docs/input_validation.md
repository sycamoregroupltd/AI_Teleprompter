# Input Validation & Sanitization

Ensuring robust input validation and sanitization is essential to protect your application against common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Both controllers and models must implement strict data validation to ensure that only properly formatted and safe data enters the system.

## Best Practices

### Validate Early and Often
- **Controller Level**: Validate all incoming HTTP requests. Use middleware or request validators to check query parameters, body data, headers, and URL parameters.
- **Model Level**: Validate data before saving it to the database. Use framework-specific validators or schema libraries to enforce data integrity.

### Sanitize Inputs
- **Remove Malicious Content**: Strip out or escape any potentially harmful characters or scripts.
- **Use Parameterized Queries**: Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized or prepared statements in database queries.
- **Escape Output**: In views and templates, always escape data to prevent XSS attacks.

### Use Established Libraries and Frameworks
- **Validation Libraries**: Utilize libraries like Joi (for Node.js) or Cerberus (for Python) to define and enforce validation schemas.
- **ORM/ODM Validations**: Use built-in validations provided by ORMs (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or Sequelize) to ensure data consistency.
- **Sanitization Tools**: Leverage libraries designed for sanitizing inputs, such as DOMPurify for web applications.

## Recommendations for Controllers and Models

### For Controllers
- Perform comprehensive validation on all incoming user data.
- Validate authentication tokens and session identifiers.
- Sanitize inputs to remove unwanted HTML, JavaScript, or SQL fragments.
- Respond with appropriate error messages if validation fails, without revealing sensitive system details.

### For Models
- Use data schemas that automatically enforce types, formats, and constraints.
- Apply sanitization rules to model fields during data persistence.
- Avoid constructing dynamic SQL queries with untrusted input; always use safe query methods.

## Summary
By rigorously validating and sanitizing input data at both the controller and model levels, you help safeguard your application against injection attacks and other malicious exploits. Adopting these practices is pivotal to maintaining data integrity and ensuring the overall security of your system.
