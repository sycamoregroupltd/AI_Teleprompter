# Microservices Architecture

As the project scales and new features are added, consider breaking parts of the system into dedicated microservices. This approach can improve scalability and fault isolation. Some potential microservices include:

- **Transcription Service**: A dedicated service responsible for audio processing and transcription. Isolating transcription tasks allows for independent scaling and fault recovery.
- **User Management Service**: A separate service to handle user account operations, authentication, and authorization. It ensures that user-related functions can be updated or scaled independently.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate microservices while handling load balancing, security, and monitoring.

Adopting a microservices architecture can enhance resiliency and streamline development by allowing individual components to be managed and scaled according to demand.
