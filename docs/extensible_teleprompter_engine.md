# Extensible Teleprompter Engine

Abstracting teleprompter behavior is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of new features and enhancements without requiring major refactoring. By designing with extensibility in mind, you can easily add capabilities such as multi-language support, voice control, or integration with other media sources.

## Key Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- **Decoupling Core Functionality:** Isolate the basic teleprompter display and timing logic from feature-specific modules such as language translation or voice control.
- **Modular Architecture:** Organize your code into independent modules or services that interact through well-defined interfaces.

### Plugin Architecture
- **Extensibility:** Design your teleprompter engine with a plugin system, allowing new features to be "plugged in" without altering the core codebase.
- **Dynamic Loading:** Support dynamic discovery and loading of new feature modules at runtime.

### Strategy Pattern
- **Flexible Behavior:** Utilize design patterns such as the Strategy Pattern to encapsulate different behaviors (e.g., text formatting, language processing, or media integration) and swap them as needed.
- **Interchangeable Components:** Define a common interface for teleprompter strategies so that new implementations can be added easily.

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Define a Core Interface
Create a core interface (or abstract base class) that defines the essential methods for teleprompter operation (e.g., display content, update timing, handle user input). This interface serves as the contract for all teleprompter modules.

### 2. Implement a Plugin Manager
Develop a plugin management system that handles:
- **Discovery:** Detecting available plugins (e.g., scanning a directory or using entry points).
- **Loading:** Dynamically importing and initializing plugins.
- **Registration:** Managing plugin lifecycles and ensuring they adhere to the defined interfaces.

### 3. Use the Strategy Pattern
Encapsulate different behaviors in separate strategy classes that implement the teleprompter interface. For example:
- **DefaultStrategy:** Handles basic teleprompter functionality.
- **MultiLanguageStrategy:** Adds real-time language translation.
- **VoiceControlStrategy:** Integrates voice commands to control the teleprompter.

### 4. Ensure Loose Coupling
Leverage dependency injection to pass the appropriate strategy or plugin to the teleprompter engine. This minimizes direct dependencies and makes it easier to test and extend the system.

## Example in Python

Below is a simplified example demonstrating an extensible teleprompter engine using the Strategy Pattern and a simple plugin manager:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Core Teleprompter Interface
class TeleprompterStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def display(self, content: str):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, new_content: str):
        pass

# Default Teleprompter Strategy
class DefaultStrategy(TeleprompterStrategy):
    def display(self, content: str):
        print(f"Displaying: {content}")

    def update(self, new_content: str):
        print(f"Updating content to: {new_content}")

# Multi-Language Strategy Plugin
class MultiLanguageStrategy(TeleprompterStrategy):
    def display(self, content: str):
        translated = self.translate(content)
        print(f"Displaying in multiple languages: {translated}")

    def update(self, new_content: str):
        translated = self.translate(new_content)
        print(f"Updating content with multi-language support to: {translated}")

    def translate(self, text: str) -> str:
        # Dummy translation logic
        return f"{text} (translated)"

# Plugin Manager to dynamically load strategies
class PluginManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = {}

    def register_plugin(self, name: str, plugin: TeleprompterStrategy):
        self.plugins[name] = plugin

    def get_plugin(self, name: str) -> TeleprompterStrategy:
        return self.plugins.get(name, DefaultStrategy())

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    manager = PluginManager()
    # Register available strategies
    manager.register_plugin("default", DefaultStrategy())
    manager.register_plugin("multilang", MultiLanguageStrategy())

    # Dynamically choose a strategy
    strategy = manager.get_plugin("multilang")
    strategy.display("Hello, world!")
    strategy.update("New content available")
```

## Benefits

- **Flexibility:** Easily introduce new features without modifying the core teleprompter logic.
- **Scalability:** Handle additional functionalities (like integration with media sources or voice control) as separate plugins.
- **Maintainability:** Facilitates cleaner code separation, allowing independent development and testing of each module.

By designing an extensible teleprompter engine with these principles, you ensure that the system remains flexible and adaptable to future feature additions without excessive refactoring.
