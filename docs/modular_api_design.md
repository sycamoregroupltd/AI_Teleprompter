# Modular API Design

Designing your API endpoints with versioning in mind is essential for maintaining backward compatibility while introducing new features or enhancements. A modular approach to API design allows you to make incremental changes without disrupting existing clients or services.

## Importance of API Versioning
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that existing clients continue to work even after new features or changes are introduced.
- **Evolution without Disruption:** Facilitate the evolution of your API by allowing simultaneous support for multiple versions.
- **Smooth Transition:** Gradually deprecate older versions while migrating clients to newer versions.

## Versioning Strategies

### URI Versioning
- **Description:** Include the API version in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`, `/api/v2/resource`).
- **Benefits:** Simple to implement and makes the version explicit.
- **Considerations:** Requires changes to endpoint routes when a new version is released.

### Header Versioning
- **Description:** Specify the API version in the request headers (e.g., using `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`).
- **Benefits:** Keeps the URL clean and allows flexible versioning.
- **Considerations:** Requires clients to set custom headers, and version detection logic must be implemented on the server.

### Query Parameter Versioning
- **Description:** Use query parameters to indicate the version (e.g., `/api/resource?version=1`).
- **Benefits:** Easy to implement and modify without altering the URL structure.
- **Considerations:** Less explicit than URI versioning and can complicate caching strategies.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Version at the Root:** When using URI versioning, include the version number at the root level for clarity.
- **Deprecation Policy:** Define a clear deprecation policy and communicate timelines for retiring old versions.
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for each API version to assist clients in migration.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test all supported versions to ensure they operate as expected without interference.
- **Monitoring:** Track API usage by version to better understand client adoption and identify when to phase out legacy versions.

By adopting these modular API design principles, you can seamlessly introduce new features while preserving stable interfaces for existing users, ensuring your API remains scalable and maintainable over time.
