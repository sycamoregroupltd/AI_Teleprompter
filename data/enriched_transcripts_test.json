    "transcript": "Good morning, sir. Hi. Hi. Hi. Is that Donna? It is. Donna, hi. It's Nigel Cox here, Wilkinson Cox. Hello, Nigel. Hi. Alright. Donna, a couple of things. One, we're just doing a, I'm just doing a quote for, to supply some York stone for a job in Essex. And we need them as sort of, they're sort of randomly laid in the lawn of stepping stones. So I've got that, I've got the meat rich, but I need them. Can we do them so they would be no smaller than about 400 or 400? It's in reclaimed. In reclaimed, in cathedral. I can't remember what you call it now. We would struggle to do that because obviously it would just cause a lot of wastage for us. Right. Okay. Okay. We just sell them random by random. We don't pick them out anymore. So most of them are the right size. So what I might do is I might talk them into ordering a little bit more than they can pick them out. Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. We used to, but now it's, it just, because of the orders, it just becomes impossible. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. The answer to that. Well, I'll work out, I'll tell you what, can you, could you send me a quote for, um, uh, 18 meters, 18 square meters? And is it 30 to 90 mil? 30 to 90. Yeah. So whatever we just had on that last job. So cathedral, I've got, I've got to get used to the new names, weren't I? Yeah. Yeah. No, that's all right. 18 square meters. All right. No problem. I'll send over. And that's, yeah. And the delivery is to Chigwell in a six. Chigwell. Okay. All right. And the other thing is that job, you've just had a lovely stone, by the way, we've nearly finished all that. Um, take it through a house. That was fun. I can tell you. Oh my goodness. The whole lot. Um, we'd got some, I ordered it quite lean because of the access. So I knew we'd need a little bit more, but we need some for, um, uh, like steps and things like that. Is there a way I can, that we can organize that with the dimensions or, or come and select out or something like that? Well, we don't have a great deal of stock. So do you know what our, our cranny yard, cause obviously everything comes directly. We, we've got a yard in man. I see. So most of it, most of it you don't see you've got it. Yeah. Yeah. Because most of it obviously comes from our boys in Manchester. So do you know what the dimensions are? Cause yeah, I could send that. I could email that through and you could give me a, give me a price on that. Um, I was just thinking what might be better for you is if we produce those in the aged because then they're all calibrated to 50 mil. So similar to the request. Yeah. Cause what I've done is I've, I've, I've selected that when we did this job, I selected some out, um, some of the nice bigger bits that we can cut and make into steps. Um, but they're originally in our brick steps that they've now done them in York. Um, but they want to be, yeah, they want to have that. They, you know, they, they, they want to be good on the, on one face anyway. Um, okay. Well, that would be perfect. That would be perfect. I can, yeah, I can send you through and I mean, could almost do it as a cutting list or something. Yeah. If you do a cutting list, then what I can do is I can send you over to the boys in the Manchester yard, but also give you a price if we did it in aged. So then you can talk to the two. Brilliant. All right. I'll, I'll pop that through. Great. Thanks for that, Donna. Okay. Lovely. Thanks a lot. Okay. Bye.",
